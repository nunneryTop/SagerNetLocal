# Brook

## `CLI` and `GUI`

-   CLI(Command-line interface)

    -   You can run commands after **entering the command-line interface**. [What is CLI(Chinese)](https://talks.txthinking.com/)
    -   Usually, everyone uses the command line interface on Linux servers. Of course, Linux also has desktops that can also run GUI
    -   Of course, macOS and Windows also have command-line interfaces, but you may not use them frequently

-   GUI(Graphical user interface)

    -   Usually, the applications opened by **double-clicking/clicking** on macOS/Windows/iOS/Android are all GUIs

## Brook CLI files and GUI files

**Usually**, if you use Brook, you will need a combination of **Server** and **Client**, **Of course** Brook CLI also has **many other independent functions**

-   Brook CLI file

    -   The Brook CLI file is an **independent command file**, it can be said that there is no concept of installation, just download this file to your computer, **run it after granting it executable permissions in the command line interface**
    -   Brook CLI file has both **server function** and **client function**, Brook CLI file also has **many other independent functions**
    -   If you are under Linux and you are not very familiar with Linux, **It is strongly recommended to use the ubuntu system and root user** to run commands. The command to switch to the root user is `$ sudo su`
    -   **Each function of Brook requires only one command, no configuration is required**

-   Brook GUI file

    -   **Keep system up to date**
    -   Brook GUI file is a graphical client, only has **client function**

**Brook files description**, all can be downloaded in [Releases](https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases) page. Of course, you can also see in the left menu that use `nami` to automatically select Brook CLI file
