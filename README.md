### Adding a new language

First and foremost, Android must already support the specific language and locale you want to add.
We cannot work with languages that Android and the SDK do not support, the tools simply break down.
Next, if you are considering adding a country-specific variant of a language (e.g. de-AT), first
make sure that the main language is well maintained (e.g. de). Your contribution might be useful to
more people if you contribute to the existing version of your language rather than the
country-specific variant.

Anyone can create a new language via Weblate.
